This repository gathers various implementations of machine learning algorithms. 

Each file in the form of Lecture_**k** contains the implementation of one or more machine learning algorithms seen during lecture number **k** of CS229.

Each algorithm is a mixture of the use of notes to keep the mathematical structure correct learned during the course, various implementation inspirations or practical tips gathered from the internet, or personal follies that materialize my quest for experimentation. But at no time do I allow myself to copy and paste, this self-destructive practice is forbidden to me.
